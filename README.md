# First pygame project
### Let's begin!
**You can download pygame [here](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)** \
**The code you can download as zip** 
### The notes
- The snake is the list of Snake class's objects 
- The direction changes according to main Snake class's object 
- Every list's element (class's obj) doesn't follow the previous 
- By the changing of direction, defines by which button
- If K_LEFT or K_RIGHT, we define if the block has catched up the previous by the \ 
height (the same with K_DOWN and K_UP, but with width)
- You can't use the left arrow after the right or up after the down
